# trying-to-contact-account-owner
Hi,

I started a company called Ofcorz and I would really like to use your Github name.

Since it appears as if you are not using your account, I was wondering if I could use the name? It would mean the world to me. :)

Thank you so much in advance.

Please send me an email on marnix.hoh@icloud.com and I hope to talk to you via email soon.

Best,
Marnix Heuker of Hoek
